Integrated Composer lets you deploy your site on Pantheon with one-click updates for both upstream commits and Composer dependencies, while still receiving upstream updates.

Pantheon is testing a release of Drupal with integrated Composer and is opening the feature to users for Limited Availability testing.

## Get Access to Integrated Composer

Integrated Composer is currently limited to customers with a Pantheon [organization](/organizations). If you are not part of an organization already, contact [Support](/support) to request access and your CSE will add you to a test organization from which you can deploy the Upstream. If you are already part of an organization, the feature can be enabled organization-wide.

## Create a Drupal or WordPress Site with Integrated Composer

1. [Fork the Pantheon-maintained repository](/create-custom-upstream#create-and-host-the-repository-remotely):

   - **Drupal**: [https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/drupal-project](https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/drupal-project).

   - **WordPress**: [https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/wordpress-project](https://github.com/pantheon-upstreams/wordpress-project).

1. [Add a new Custom Upstream](/create-custom-upstream#connect-repository-to-pantheon) on the Pantheon dashboard.

1. Create a new Drupal 8 or WordPress site from the Upstream.

   - Do not customize the upstream yet.

   - **Drupal 8**: Set the site's Development Mode to [SFTP](/sftp#sftp-mode).

1. In the Dev environment, click **Visit Development Site** and follow the prompts to complete the CMS installation.

1. [Clone the site locally](/local-development#get-the-code) and run `composer install`.

## Upstream and Site Structure

The upstream has the following directory structure:

```none:title=core/
core/
├─ .gitignore
├─ composer.json
└─ pantheon.upstream.yml
├─ README.md
└─ upstream-configuration/
   └─ composer.json
```

- `.gitignore`: Prevents build artifacts generated by Composer from being committed to the upstream or site code repositories.
- `composer.json`: The two different `composer.json` files allow customization of individual sites without inherent merge conflicts and enable one-click updates.
  - Root-level: Site-level customizations.
  - `upstream-config/composer.json`: Composer automatically updates `composer.json` with customizations for the upstream. Avoid manually modifying this file.
- `pantheon.upstream.yml`: The `build_step: true` directive in `pantheon.upstream.yml` enables the build step. This name is temporary and will change.

When a site is created, Pantheon runs `composer install`, generates a `composer.lock` file and commits it back to the site’s code repository.

Build artifacts are stored in a Git tag like `pantheon_build_artifacts_$BRANCHNAME` (where `$BRANCHNAME` is the name of the environment or Multidev feature branch).

## How to Add Dependencies to Your Upstream

1. Start with the local clone of the upstream repository you created above.

1. Change into the `upstream-config` directory:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  cd upstream-config
  ```

1. Run:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  composer require drupal/pkg-name --no-update
  ```

   `--no-update` tells Composer to disable automatic updates of the dependency. This makes Composer faster when adding dependencies to the Upstream as shown here. `--no-update` should not be included when adding dependencies to a site.

1. Set or increment the current configuration version:

   - If this is your first time setting the config version:

     Confirm the version:

     ```bash{outputLines:2}
     composer config version
     1.0.0
     ```

   - Increment the config version number when you update dependencies. If you don't increment the version number, Composer will ignore updated dependencies. Replace `x.y.z` in this example with something like `1.0.1`:

     ```bash{promptUser: user}
     composer config version x.y.z
     ```

1. Commit and push.

## Apply One-click Updates

Navigate to **Code** in the Dev tab of the site's Dashboard.

Click **Check Now**. If updates are available, click **Apply Updates**.

## Add a Dependency to an Individual Site

1. Clone the Git repository from the Pantheon site's dashboard.

1. Run `composer install`:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  composer install
  ```

1. Add a new dependency locally:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  composer require drupal/pkg-name
  ```

1. Commit `composer.json` and `composer.lock` and push.

   - Pantheon will run Composer, generate build artifacts, and deploy it to your Dev or Multidev environment.

1. Remove dependencies:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  composer remove drupal/pkg-name
  ```

## Pantheon's Scope of Support for Composer

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

### What Composer commands does Pantheon run?

All Composer commands are available through the **Commit Log** in the Site Dashboard's development environment.

### How do I view Composer's changes?

Use `git diff` to view changes, excluding composer.lock

```bash{promptUser: user}
git diff d94d1a1179 -- . ':(exclude)composer.lock'
```

Try [composer-lock-diff](https://github.com/davidrjonas/composer-lock-diff) to see what packages have changed after `composer update`.
