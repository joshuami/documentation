Drupal 9 is, according to [drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/docs/understanding-drupal/drupal-9-resources):

> "...a cleaned-up version of Drupal 8... \[with] deprecated code removed and third-party dependencies updated."

Drupal 9 updates Drupal’s underlying dependencies like [Symfony 4.4](https://symfony.com/releases/4.4) and [Twig 2](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/index.html), removes several deprecated API functions in favor of better options, and allows everyone running Drupal 8.8+ an easy upgrade path to Drupal 9 and beyond.

<Alert title="A note about Early Access" type="danger">

**Support for Early Access releases is limited.**

Currently, Drupal 9 is only available on Pantheon as an Early Access feature release. This means the feature is currently in active development and is intended for testing and evaluation purposes only.

Pantheon engineers are rolling out changes often, and easy updates from Drupal 9 Early Access are not guaranteed.

</Alert>

Test Drupal 9 with a fresh installation using either Integrated Composer (currently in Limited Availability) or Build Tools:

- [Create a new Drupal 9 site with integrated Composer](#create-a-new-drupal-9-site-with-integrated-composer).
  - If you simply want to test the browser experience of Drupal 9 and get access to forthcoming Pantheon support for Composer in the Dashboard.

- [Create a new Drupal 9 Site with Continuous Integration and Build Tools](#create-a-drupal-9-site-with-continuous-integration-via-build-tools).
  - To create a new site with a continuous integration (**CI**) workflow using GitHub.

## Create a New Drupal 9 Site with Integrated Composer

## Create a Drupal 9 Site with Continuous Integration via Build Tools

Want to regularly develop with continuous integration (CI) and automated tests? Leverage Pantheon’s [Build Tools](/guides/build-tools) to get up and running quickly with a CI workflow to build, test, and deploy Drupal 9.

These steps use GitHub and CircleCI:

1. Install the [Terminus Build Tools plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-build-tools-plugin).
   - This will require generating a [Pantheon machine token](/machine-tokens), a [CircleCI API token](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/), and a [GitHub API credential](https://developer.github.com/v3/#authentication).

1. Enable support for custom CircleCI Orbs in your Organizational settings. In CircleCI, click **Settings**, then **Security**, and under **Allow Uncertified Orbs** click **Yes**:

   ![Allow Uncertified Orbs in CircleCI](../images/circleci/circleci-allow-uncertified-orbs.png)

1. Use Terminus to create a new Drupal 9 site, complete with a customizable CI workflow. Remember to replace `<NEW-SITE-NAME>` in this example with a name for your new site, and `optional-pantheon-organization-name` with your choice (if any):

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  terminus build:project:create "pantheon-systems/drupal-9-with-circleci-orb:dev-master" <NEW-SITE-MACHINE-NAME> --stability=dev --team='optional-pantheon-organization-name'
  ```

## Test an Existing Drupal Site for Drupal 9 Upgrade Compatibility

1. Upgrade to the latest Drupal 8.9 release.

   - Although Drupal supports upgrading to Drupal 9 from Drupal 8.8, ensure that your site is on the latest Drupal 8.9 release before trying Drupal 9 on Pantheon.

1. Review the [How to Prepare Your Drupal 7 or Drupal 8 Site for Drupal 9](https://www.drupal.org/docs/9/how-to-prepare-your-drupal-7-or-8-site-for-drupal-9) guide on Drupal.org.

1. Use the [Upgrade Status](https://www.drupal.org/project/upgrade_status) Drupal 8/9 module to generate a full report of your site’s compatibility.

1. Check out [Acquia’s Drupal 9 Deprecation Status Upgrade Tracker](https://dev.acquia.com/drupal9/deprecation_status) for information about Drupal 9 support for contributed Drupal modules and themes.

### Update Deprecated Code for Drupal 9 Compatibility

Drupal 9 has deprecated a number of different functions and APIs in favor of better options going forward.

For example, `node_load()` was replaced in Drupal 9 with `Node::load` resulting in this change needed:

Drupal 8:

```php
$node = node_load(1);
```

Drupal 9:

```php
use \Drupal\node\Entity\Node;
$node = Node::load(1);
```

Since most of these changes are relatively minor, there are a number of [deprecation checking and correction tools](https://www.drupal.org/docs/9/how-to-prepare-your-drupal-7-or-8-site-for-drupal-9/deprecation-checking-and-correction-tools) available.

## Test-upgrade an Existing Pantheon Drupal 8 Site to Drupal 9

Are you already running a Pantheon site using our [Drupal 8 upstream](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/drops-8)? Use our [Multidev](/multidev) feature to test Drupal 9 in a new branch.

1. Clone your Drupal 8 site’s codebase [to your computer](/local-development#get-the-code) and change directory to it. You can create a new Drupal 8 site or use an existing Drupal 8 site:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  git clone <url for site repo>
  cd <site-name>
  ```

1. Install the [Terminus D9 Preview plugin](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus-d9-preview) to create a Multidev environment called `preview-d9` on your Drupal 8 site for testing:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  composer create-project -d ~/.terminus/plugins pantheon-systems/terminus-d9-preview:^0.1
  ```

1. Create and switch to a new testing Multidev:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  terminus preview:d9
  ```

1. Modify the `pantheon.yml` file to specify PHP 7.3 or newer and Drush 8:

  ```yaml:title=pantheon.yml
  php_version: 7.4
  drush_version: 8
  ```

  Note that Drupal 9 is not yet compatible with the pre-installed Drush 10 on Pantheon.

1. Commit and push your changes:

  ```bash{promptUser: user}
  git commit -am "test upgrade to Drupal 9"
  git push origin preview-d9
  ```

You should not attempt to merge your Drupal 9 preview Multidev into the dev environment until Drupal 9 is officially supported on Pantheon.

### Refresh Existing preview-d9 Multidev With Latest Dev Environment

This destroys the code, database and files on the existing `preview-d9` Multidev and re-creates it from the latest dev environment. Save any changes you made on this environment to your local computer before refreshing the environment.

If you make changes to your dev environment that you want to test in Drupal 9, run `terminus preview:d9` again to update the existing Multidev:

```bash{promptUser: user}
terminus preview:d9
```
