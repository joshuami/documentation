## Before You Begin

First, verify caching configuration to ensure anonymous caching is enabled. Then test to determine if CDN caching is working on your site:

- To enable anonymous caching within Drupal, see [Drupal Performance and Caching Settings](/drupal-cache).
- WordPress sites on Pantheon have anonymous caching enabled by default. See [WordPress Pantheon Cache Plugin Configuration](/wordpress-cache-plugin) for details.
- See [Testing Global CDN Caching](/test-global-cdn-caching) for steps to test.

If you see `Age: 0` after multiple requests, your site is not caching properly.

### Cache Related Headers

<dl>

<dt ignored>cache-control</dt>

<dd>

Determines caching behaviors for the given request, this configuration is set by WordPress and Drupal.

</dd>

<dt ignored>age</dt>

<dd>

How long the content has been stored in cache. If 0, the response was produced by WordPress or Drupal and not served from cache.

</dd>

<dt ignored>set-cookie</dt>

<dd>

Generated by WordPress or Drupal to send data back to the browser. The platform will not cache a response that contains the `set-cookie` header.

</dd>

</dl>

## Debug Caching Issues
Understand caching behavior for a given page by analyzing cache related HTTP headers from the command line with `curl`. For example:

```bash{outputLines: 2-20}
curl -I https://www.example.com
HTTP/2 200
cache-control: public, max-age=600 // highlight-line
content-type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
server: nginx
//highlight-start
set-cookie: cookielawinfo-checkbox-necessary=yes; expires=Thu, 20-Feb-2020 17:31:51 GMT; Max-Age=3600; path=/
set-cookie: cookielawinfo-checkbox-non-necessary=yes; expires=Thu, 20-Feb-2020 17:31:51 GMT; Max-Age=3600; path=/
//highlight-end
x-pantheon-styx-hostname: styx-fe1-a-789d66bff9-tztp6
x-styx-req-id: 7f93c166-53fe-11ea-803e-b26d7703e33f
date: Thu, 20 Feb 2020 16:31:51 GMT
x-served-by: cache-mdw17379-MDW, cache-chi21146-CHI
x-cache: MISS, MISS
x-cache-hits: 0, 0
x-timer: S1582216311.492451,VS0,VE204
vary: Accept-Encoding, Cookie, Cookie
age: 0 // highlight-line
accept-ranges: bytes
via: 1.1 varnish
```

If you see `Age: 0` after multiple requests, your site is not caching properly.

This particular example is covered in [WordPress Plugins and Themes with Known Issues](/plugins-known-issues#gdpr-cookie-consent).

### Set-Cookie Conflicts
Pantheon's platform will not cache a response that contains the `set-cookie` header.

<Alert title="Warning" type="danger" >

Do not use Curl to debug this scenario. Instead, investigate `set-cookie` issues and fixes from your browser, for instructions see [Test Global CDN with Browser Headers](/test-global-cdn-caching#test-global-cdn-with-browser-headers). Curl does not handle cookie data in the way that your browser does and effectively misrepresents cookie and caching behavior as a result.

</Alert>

Search for instances across the site's codebase and once isolated, edit the cookie name so that is matches the `STYXKEY[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+` naming convention.

Next, wrap a conditional statement around the `setcookie();` function to check whether the cookie is already defined in the request. The goal of this effort is to send `set-cookie` only on the initial request, and never on subsequent requests.

For example, if a theme file sets a cookie as:

```php
$cookie_name = 'cookies_disclaimer_id_'.$page_id;
$cookie_value = $page_slug;
$cookie_path = '/'.$page_slug.'/';
setcookie($cookie_name, $cookie_value, time() + (86400 * 30), $cookie_path); // 86400 = 1 day
```

Edit to:

```php
$cookie_name = 'STYXKEY_cookies_disclaimer_id_'.$page_id;
$cookie_value = $page_slug;
$cookie_path = '/'.$page_slug.'/';
if (isset($_COOKIE['STYXKEY_cookies_disclaimer_id_'.$page_id])){}
else {
  setcookie($cookie_name, $cookie_value, time() + (86400 * 30), $cookie_path); // 86400 = 1 day
}
```

The initial request will still break through cache - that's expected, because it would not find anything defined for the cookie. Subsequent requests back to the site should find the cookie data defined in the request headers. Subsequent requests should not be sendign `set-cookie` and should now be served by cache.

Again, avoid testing via curl for the `set-cookie` conflict. When it comes to cookies, Curl doesn't send the value back like your browser would so subsequent requests present as failures no matter what.

### Drupal Config Conflicts

If the `cache-control` header returns `private, must-revalidate` unexpectedly, even after enabling anonymous caching across the site, it's possible that there's a conflicting override somewhere.

- Check `settings.php` files for configuration overrides. For example, maybe there's an existing `$conf['cache']` set to `0` that should be adjusted to `1`.

- Or the conflict could be coming from a contrib module. For example, if the Domain module is in use, check performance for that particular module (e.g., `/admin/structure/domain/view/1/config`), which overrides the site performance config (`/admin/config/development/performance`).

### WordPress Sessions

Due to how caching and sessions work, sessions need to be uncached to work properly. It is impossible to use cached content when there are sessions in place. Best practice is to use a cookie based solution to avoid a performance hit from uncached session pages.
